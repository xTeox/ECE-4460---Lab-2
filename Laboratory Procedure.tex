\section{Laboratory Procedure}

\subsection{Main Clock Frequency}

The main purpose of this procedure is to introduce debugging with Dynamic C and calculate the clock frequency of the system with a simple loop program that sums 2 numbers. Using the program LAB1A.c provided, some modifications were made in order to calculate and show the
