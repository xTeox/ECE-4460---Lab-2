\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this lab is to become familiar with internal interrupt service routines (IISRs), aka synchronous interrupts, by using the kernel of the real-time operational system (RTOS) μC/OS-II in the IDE environment of Dynamic C to program in a Rabbit 2000 microprocessor unit of a development board Wildcat BL2000. Also, a sample of code to the configuration of a simple real-time operational system using μC/OS-II is provided.
